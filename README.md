# 🐍 Python Learning Journey 🚀

This repository tracks my progress learning Python from scratch.  
Each file demonstrates a concept I’ve studied — from variables to loops, functions, and beyond.

## 🗓️ My Goal

To build a strong foundation in Python and eventually transition into **AI development**.  
This repo is my way of staying consistent, documenting what I learn, and sharing progress.

## 📌 Platforms Used

- 🟢 **Mimo (Pro)** – For structured Python fundamentals  
- 🔵 **Hyperskill** – For deeper understanding and **project-based learning**

---

## 🧠 Side Notes

I reflect weekly in my [learning journal](learning-journal/).  
It includes notes on what clicked, what didn’t, and lessons from building real projects.

---

## 📍 What's Next

- Expand Python fundamentals (functions, error handling, files, OOP)  
- Keep building more projects (games, tools, data tools)  
- Transition into **statistics, data structures**, and **machine learning**
