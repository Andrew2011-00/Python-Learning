# Python Learning Journey 🚀

This repository tracks my progress learning Python from scratch using Mimo Pro.  
Each file demonstrates a concept I’ve studied (e.g., variables, loops, functions).


## ✅ Topics Covered So Far:
- Variables and strings
- Basic print statements

## 🗓️ My Goal
To build a strong foundation in Python and eventually transition into AI development.
