# 🧠 Week 6 – Python Learning Journal

This week I completed two projects on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org), which helped me reinforce the basics and apply them in small but meaningful ways. Both projects were straightforward overall, but I did run into a few challenges that helped me understand where I still need to improve.

## ✅ Projects Completed

### 1. Simple Tic Tac Toe 🎮
This was a console-based version of the classic game. The logic behind validating moves and checking for win conditions took me a bit to figure out, especially structuring the board and handling user input cleanly. Once I got the logic down, everything else flowed pretty naturally.

### 2. Loan Calculator 💰
This one involved building a command-line tool that could calculate loan payments based on different arguments. I struggled a little with the `argparse` module at first — especially with required vs optional arguments and making sure the input was validated correctly — but it started to make more sense as I worked through it.

## 🔁 Reflections

- These projects were pretty basic, but they helped tie together a lot of the things I’ve learned so far — especially conditionals, loops, functions, and now some intro-level command-line argument parsing.
- I’m gaining more confidence working with real inputs and thinking through logic more independently.
