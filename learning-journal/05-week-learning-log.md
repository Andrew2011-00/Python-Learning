# 📅 Week 5 Log – Learning Journal

## 🧠 What I Worked On
This week was a bit slower because I ran into technical issues that blocked some progress, but I still completed one meaningful project.

### ✅ Project Completed:
- **Honest Calculator (Hyperskill)**

### ❌ What Didn’t Go As Planned:
I initially planned to work on the **Learning Progress Tracker** project, but I spent several days trying to fix issues with the IDE (PyCharm).  
Specifically:
- The “Check Solution” feature wasn’t working properly.
- Test cases were failing or not running even though my code produced the correct output manually.
- I tried different solutions and configurations, but nothing worked.

Eventually, I decided to move on so I wouldn’t waste more time stuck.

## 🧮 Honest Calculator – Highlights
This was a fun project, even if a bit tricky at times. It wasn’t too hard overall, but:
- The logic to handle user input and calculate results had to be carefully structured.
- It was sometimes hard to keep track of conditions and flow, especially with multiple `if` statements.
- I learned the importance of clean and logical flow in user-facing programs.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Don't let technical problems stall your progress forever — it's okay to move on and revisit later.
- Be patient with logic-heavy programs. Break problems into smaller steps and test often.
- Even one good project a week is progress.

## 📌 Goals for Next Week
- Revisit the **Learning Progress Tracker** and try to get it working.
- Complete at least one more project from Hyperskill.
- Keep documenting everything I learn.
