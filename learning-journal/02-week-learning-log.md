# 📓 Week 3 – Learning Log

## 🗓️ Dates
Week 2 of my Python learning journey.

## ✅ Projects Completed
- ✅ Project 1: Chatbot with Python  
- ✅ Project 2: Zookeeper with Python  
- ✅ Project 3: Corner Shop Calculator

## 💭 Reflections

This was a great intro week. All three projects were **fairly easy**, but still valuable.  
They helped me refresh my **very basic understanding of Python**, like printing, variables, and user input.

Even though I’ve seen most of these concepts before, it felt good to **put them into small projects** right away — much better than just reading or watching tutorials.

## 🧠 What I Improved

- Refreshed basic syntax (variables, `print()`, `input()`)
- Got used to Python’s indentation and structure
- Built confidence starting and finishing small programs

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Keep building on this foundation  
- Start working with conditionals and more complex logic
