# 🗓️ Week 01 Learning Log

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Variables and strings in Python
- Basic `print()` statements
- Using file extensions properly (`.py` vs `.txt`)
- Introduction to Git and GitHub
- Git commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, merge handling

## 💻 Files/Projects Created
- `variables.py`: Practiced assigning and printing variables in Python

## ✅ Achievements
- Finished Section 1 of Mimo (Intro to Python)
- Successfully set up Git and GitHub
- Resolved a Git merge conflict and pushed code to GitHub
- Created and published my first learning journal on GitHub!

## 💡 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- `.py` files can accidentally be saved as `.txt` on Windows — need to check file extensions
- How to navigate Git errors like “non-fast-forward” and merge conflicts
- Nano editor basics (`Ctrl + O`, `Ctrl + X`)
- GitHub is not just for projects — it’s great for showing your learning journey

## 🔧 Struggles & Fixes
- **Problem:** GitHub wouldn’t accept my push
  - What didn’t work: Just pushing without pulling first
  - How I solved it: Learned about merge conflicts, used `git pull`, resolved in Nano, then pushed successfully
- **Problem:** Couldn’t open Git Bash in a folder at first
  - Fixed by using the Windows right-click fix and navigating to the folder manually

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals
- Finish Mimo sections on loops and conditionals
- Create new `.py` files for each concept I learn
- Try building a small Python guessing game as a mini project

## 📌 Notes to Future Me
- Always pull before pushing if working from multiple devices or if GitHub has new changes
- Use journals to reflect, not just track — lessons learned from bugs are often more valuable than lessons from success
