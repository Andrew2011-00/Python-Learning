🗓️ Week 01 Learning Log

---

📚 Topics Covered
- Variables and strings in Python
- True and False Values
- Basic print() statements
- Checking Number Equality using `==` and `!=`
- Formatting Strings
- Using file extensions properly (.py vs .txt)
- Introduction to Git and GitHub
- Git commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, merge handling

---

📌 Platform Update
I started this week learning with **Mimo (Pro)** and completed the Intro to Python section over 2 days. While Mimo helped me get comfortable with the basics, I decided to switch to **Hyperskill (Premium)** for a more structured and project-based learning approach. I’m now following the **Python for Beginners** track on Hyperskill, which aligns better with my goal of becoming an AI developer through my upcoming Computing and IT with Statistics degree.

💻 Files/Projects Created
- `Bot - Part 1` (Mimo Project)
- `variables.py`: Practiced assigning and printing variables in Python
- `True_False.py`: Practiced printing True or False values using `==` and `!=`
- `Format_String.py`: Practiced formatting strings

---

✅ Achievements
- Finished Section 1 of Mimo (Intro to Python)
- Successfully set up Git and GitHub
- Resolved a Git merge conflict and pushed code to GitHub
- Created and published my first learning journal on GitHub!

---

💡 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- `.py` files can accidentally be saved as `.txt` on Windows — need to double-check file extensions
- How to navigate Git errors like “non-fast-forward” and merge conflicts
- Nano editor basics (Ctrl + O, Ctrl + X)
- GitHub isn’t just for polished projects — it’s also a powerful way to show your learning journey

---

🔧 Struggles & Fixes
- **Problem:** GitHub wouldn’t accept my push  
  **What didn’t work:** Just pushing without pulling first  
  **Solution:** Learned about merge conflicts, used `git pull`, resolved in Nano, then pushed successfully

- **Problem:** Couldn’t open Git Bash in a folder at first  
  **Solution:** Fixed by using the Windows right-click workaround and navigating to the folder manually

🎯 Next Week’s Goals
- Continue the Hyperskill Python for Beginners track
- Create new `.py` files for each new concept
- Build a small Python guessing game as a mini project

---

📌 Notes to Future Me
- Always pull before pushing if working from multiple devices or if GitHub has new changes
- Use journals to reflect, not just track — lessons learned from bugs are often more valuable than those from smooth success
