# 📓 Week 4 – Learning Log

## 🗓️ Dates
Week 4 of my Python learning journey.

## ✅ Projects Completed
- ✅ Project 5: Currency Converter  
- ✅ Project 6: Bill Splitter  
- ✅ Project 7: Coffee Machine

## 💭 Reflections

This week was **very productive** — I completed **three full projects**.  
Most of them were fairly straightforward and good practice for user input, math logic, and clean output.

But **Project 7 (Coffee Machine)** was the hardest one so far. It was the first time I had to use **functions** to split the program into smaller parts, and I also started encountering concepts related to **classes**.  
At first it was confusing and frustrating, so I ended up building an extra practice project (`Extra-Virtual_Vending_Machine.py`) to break down the logic before tackling the final one.

That helped a lot, and I’m proud I didn’t give up. After that, finishing the project felt great.

## 🧠 What I Improved

- Using functions to organize and reuse code
- Understanding the basics of stateful programs
- Gaining confidence in breaking problems down

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Practice more with functions and start learning about classes properly  
- Begin reviewing past projects to improve readability and structure  
- Keep working through Hyperskill and try experimenting with my own variations
