# 📓 Week 3 – Learning Log

## 🗓️ Dates
Week 3 of my Python learning journey.

## ✅ Projects Completed
- ✅ Project 4: Last Pencil  
  A simple pencil-removal game with basic game logic and input validation.

## 💭 Reflections

This week I worked on **Project 4 (Last Pencil)**, which turned out to be slightly more challenging than the earlier ones.  
It was a longer project with more moving parts — especially managing player turns and keeping the logic clean.  
Still, it was satisfying to finish and I understood most of it with some careful thinking.

By now, I'm starting to feel more comfortable with `if` statements, loops, and thinking through program logic step by step.

## 🧠 What I Improved

- Handling user input more carefully
- Thinking in terms of game state and player turns
- Structuring slightly longer programs

## 🔜 Next Steps

Move on to more practical projects involving calculations, conversions, and real-world tasks.
