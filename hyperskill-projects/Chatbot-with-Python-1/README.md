# 🤖 Chatbot with Python (Hyperskill Project)

This is a simple console-based chatbot project I completed as part of my Python learning journey on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org). The goal of the project was to apply core Python concepts by building a chatbot that interacts with the user through different stages — from greetings to guessing their age, counting, and playing a quiz.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I practiced and reinforced the following Python fundamentals:

- 📜 **Basic Syntax** and writing multi-line programs
- 🔢 **Data Types**: strings, integers, booleans
- 🧮 **Integer Arithmetic** and basic math operations
- 🧑‍💻 **Taking User Input** using `input()`
- 🔄 **Loops**: `while` loops for iteration
- 🧠 **Boolean Logic** and comparisons
- ⚡ **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else`
- 🔢 **Lists** and using indexes
- 🧰 **Functions**: declaring and calling functions to organize code

## 📋 Project Stages

This project was completed in 5 stages as part of the Hyperskill platform:

1. **Meet the Chatbot** – Basic print statements and structure
2. **Introduce Yourself** – Ask for and respond to user input
3. **Guess Your Age** – Use modulo math and arithmetic to guess age
4. **Count to a Number** – Practice with loops and iteration
5. **Simple Quiz** – Build a multiple-choice question with logic

## 🎯 Skills Practiced

- Writing clean and readable Python code
- Structuring programs using functions
- Debugging and learning through trial and error
- Understanding user interaction in console applications
- Practicing logic and control flow

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-learning.git
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd python-learning/hyperkill-projects/Chatbot-with-Python-1/
4. Run the Chatbot:
   ```bash
   python Chatbot-with-Python.py

## ✅ Reflection

This was a Hyperskill project that helped me get comfortable with the basics of Python programming. I initially struggled with while loops and structuring functions, but through trial and error, I gradually improved. Watching the chatbot evolve step by step made learning both fun and practical.

Feel free to explore the code and play with it — or build your own chatbot using the same structure and logic!
