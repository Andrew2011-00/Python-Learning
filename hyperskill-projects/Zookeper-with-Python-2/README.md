# 🐇 Zookeper with Python (Hyperskill Project)

This is a simple project I completed as part of my Python learning journey on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org). In this project i built a simple monitoring system. This project takes a user's command and displays animal information, making the use feel like areal zookeeper.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I practiced and reinforced the following Python fundamentals:

- 📜 **Basic Syntax** and writing multi-line programs
- 🔢 **Data Types**: strings, integers, booleans
- 🧮 **Integer Arithmetic** and basic math operations
- 🧑‍💻 **Taking User Input** using `input()`
- 🔄 **Loops**: `while` loops for iteration
- 🧠 **Boolean Logic** and comparisons
- 🔢 **Lists** and using indexes

## 📋 Project Stages

This project was completed in 5 stages as part of the Hyperskill platform:

1. **Rush into print** – Basic print statement and structure
2. **Show me an animal** – Shows the user an image of an animal
3. **What's inside** – The user is shown what it is inside each habitat.
4. **Sustainable care** – Practice with loops and iteration

## 🎯 Skills Practiced

- Writing clean and readable Python code
- Understanding user interaction in console applications
- Practicing logic and control flow

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-learning.git
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd python-learning/hyperkill-projects/Zookeper-with-Python-2/
4. Run the Chatbot:
   ```bash
   python zookeper.py

✅ Reflection
This project was a great follow-up to the Chatbot project I did earlier on Hyperskill. It allowed me to apply everything I had already learned — like using variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and user input — but in a more straightforward and less complex way. Since I was already familiar with the concepts, I found it much easier and quicker to complete.

Even though it was a simple project, it helped reinforce my understanding and made me feel much more confident working with Python. It showed me how far I’ve come and reminded me that repetition really helps solidify skills.

Feel free to explore the code and play with it — or build your own zoo using the same structure and logic!
