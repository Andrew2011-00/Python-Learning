# 🤑 Corner Shop Calculator with Python (Hyperskill Project)

This is a simple console-based income calculator project I completed as part of my Python learning journey on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org). The goal of the project was to build a tool to track earnings by inputting product sales, staff costs, and other expenses and watch Python create a practical calculator that will give a clear picture of the shop's financial health.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I practiced and reinforced the following Python fundamentals:

- 📜 **Basic Syntax** and writing multi-line programs
- 🔢 **Data Types**: strings, integers, booleans
- 🧮 **Integer Arithmetic** and basic math operations
- 🧑‍💻 **Taking User Input** using `input()`
- 🖊️ **Sep and end arguments of print

## 📋 Project Stages

This project was completed in 5 stages as part of the Hyperskill platform:

1. **Print the prices** – Basic print statements and structure
2. **Measure total income of your shop** – Basic arithmetic to calculate total income
3. **Calculate net income** – Use arithmetic and f string to calculate total income from user's input

✅ Reflection

This was the simplest project I’ve done so far — it focused on basic user input and printing output to the console. Even though it was designed to be a beginner-level project, I ended up doing it after completing some of the more advanced ones like the Chatbot.
Because of that, it felt very easy and straightforward, but it was still a nice reminder of how much I've learned. It also gave me a chance to appreciate the basics again and see how comfortable I’ve become with writing simple Python programs without overthinking them.

Feel free to explore the code and play with it — or build your own chatbot using the same structure and logic!
