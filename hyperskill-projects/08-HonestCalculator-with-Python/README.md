# üßÆ Honest Calculator

A basic calculator project built as part of the Hyperskill Python Developer track.  
The goal was to create a simple calculator that interacts with the user, performs arithmetic operations, and responds with "honest" commentary depending on how trivial or complex the inputs are.

## üöÄ Features
- Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Identifies lazy or overly simple calculations (e.g. multiplying by 1 or adding 0).
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully with custom error messages.
- Continuously asks the user for new calculations until the user decides to quit.

## üß† What I Learned
- How to structure input validation in a conversational program.
- How to chain multiple conditional checks in a readable way.
- How to build user-friendly CLI applications.
- Importance of thinking ahead in terms of logic flow, especially when dealing with multiple input types and edge cases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges
- Some parts of the logic were tricky to manage cleanly, especially when combining validation and "honest" feedback messages.
- Needed to slow down and test each section to make sure it worked as expected.
