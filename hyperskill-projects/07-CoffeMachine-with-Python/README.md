## 🔄 Extra Practice

This project was **initially difficult to understand**, especially the logic flow and state management.  
To consolidate my understanding, I created a separate practice project:

📁 `Extra-Virtual_Vending_Machine.py`  
It helped me break down the core logic before completing the final Coffee Machine project.
